## 🚀 My Projects
Here are a few things I've built:

- **[ration_card_processor](https://github.com/discoveraniket/ration_card_processor)**: A real-world automation tool for processing ration cards, demonstrating my expertise in OCR, document processing, and practical application development.
- **[Macbeth Learning App](https://github.com/discoveraniket/macbeth-learning-app)**: An educational application designed to enhance the learning and understanding of Shakespeare's Macbeth, initially developed to support an English professor in coaching students.
- **[CogniTrain](https://github.com/discoveraniket/CogniTrain)**: An application designed to help students prepare for MCQ-based competitive exams, with a live version available [here](https://examprep.pythonanywhere.com/).

### 💼 Commercial & Confidential Projects
A significant portion of my work involves developing proprietary, monetizable software solutions for clients. While the source code is confidential, these projects showcase my ability to tackle complex, real-world business problems.

- **[AutoWeb (Desktop Automation Tool)](https://github.com/discoveraniket/autoWeb?tab=readme-ov-file#autoweb-excel-to-web-portal-automation)**: A prime example is **AutoWeb**, a desktop application built to automate the tedious process of transferring data from Excel to a web portal. This tool transformed a manual, error-prone task into an efficient, unattended workflow, creating a recurring revenue stream.
  - **Key Achievements:**
    - Engineered a responsive GUI using a multi-threaded architecture to prevent UI freezes during heavy automation tasks.
    - Implemented resilient web automation with Playwright, incorporating anti-bot evasion and dynamic content handling.
    - Developed a secure, offline, pay-per-use licensing system using encryption to manage client quotas.

I can discuss the architecture, technical challenges, and business impact of such projects in more detail privately.

## 💡 My Development Philosophy

I'm currently rigorously exploring "vibe coding" techniques, particularly through tools like `gemini-cli`. My perspective is that these are not shortcuts to avoid fundamental understanding, but rather powerful accelerators—much like how power tools enable a craftsman to build more intricate and larger structures than would be feasible with only hand tools. This approach allows me to tackle more complex problems and deliver sophisticated solutions in significantly less time, pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
