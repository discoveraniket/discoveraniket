# 👋 Hi, I’m Aniket Sarkar

I'm a graduate in **Physics**, a self-taught Python developer, and an enthusiast in automation and AI integration. I currently work full-time in the government sector in a non-technical role — but I’ve been writing code since 2010, and I never stopped.

## 💻 What I Do

- 🐍 Build automation scripts using **Python + Playwright/Selenium**
- 🤖 Integrate **AI models** (like Gemini API) into real-world tools
- 📚 Create educational apps — like my [Macbeth Learning App](https://github.com/discoveraniket/macbeth-learning-app)
- 📈 Invest in long-term wealth creation and believe in using tech to accelerate growth

## 🧠 Currently Learning
- API integrations (REST, JSON)
- JavaScript & frontend basics
- Building portfolio-ready projects

## 🔍 Looking For
- Freelance automation & AI integration projects
- Collaborators interested in building small, real-world tools
- Opportunities to turn code into income

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python • Playwright • Selenium • Streamlit • Flask • Gemini API
- HTML/CSS (Basic) • JavaScript (Learning)
- Git & GitHub
