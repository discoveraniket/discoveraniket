# 👋 Hi, I’m Aniket Sarkar

I'm a self-taught Python developer and automation enthusiast, currently working in a government-run animal health centre. Though my day job is non-technical, I’ve been writing code since 2010 — and I never stopped.

## 💻 What I Do

- 🤖 Integrate **AI models** (like Gemini API) into real-world tools
- 📚 Create educational apps — like my [Macbeth Learning App](https://github.com/discoveraniket/macbeth-learning-app)
- 📈 Invest in long-term wealth creation and believe in using tech to accelerate growth

## 🧠 Currently Learning
- API integrations (REST, JSON)
- JavaScript & Frontend Basics
- Building portfolio-ready projects

## 🔍 Looking For
- Freelance automation projects
- Collaborators interested in small, real-world tools
- Opportunities to turn code into income

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python • Playwright • Streamlit • Flask • Gemini API
